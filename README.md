### Introduction

CRYPTON specialises in software development, leveraging crowdsourced methodologies to deliver exceptional results. Our tech stack focuses on AWS Amplify, React, React Native, Vite, and Tailwind CSS.

### Development Workflow

Our development workflow is based on a customised GitFlow process tailored to support flexibility and rapid adaptation to project needs. Key aspects include small, incremental commits, detailed issue tracking, and a rigorous code review process.

### Branching Strategy

We implement an adapted GitFlow model comprising:
- **Main Branch**: Production-ready code.
- **Develop Branch**: Integration branch for the next release.
- **Feature/Branch**: Development of new features or enhancements.
- **Hotfix Branches**: Immediate fixes to production code.

### Issue Tracking and Management

All tasks, enhancements, and bugs are managed using GitHub Issues, complemented by GitHub Projects for sprint planning. Issues should be clear and detailed and include acceptance criteria for development and testing.

### CI/CD Pipelines

Our GitHub Actions workflows automate testing, linting, and deployments. These pipelines ensure code quality from the initial stages of development and facilitate efficient delivery.

### Security and Access Control

Access to repositories and sensitive information is managed via Azure Active Directory (AAD), ensuring secure and efficient access control. Regular audits are performed to maintain the integrity of our development environment.

### Feedback and Continuous Improvement

Feedback is a cornerstone of our development process. Regular retrospectives and open channels for feedback ensure continuous improvement and adaptation of our workflows and practices.
